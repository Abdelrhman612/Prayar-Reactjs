# Prayer Times Application

A React-based application that displays Islamic prayer times for different cities in Egypt. The app fetches prayer times from the Aladhan API and presents them in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Displays all five daily prayer times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha)
- Shows the current Gregorian date
- Allows users to select different Egyptian cities
- Responsive design with RTL support for Arabic
- Beautiful background with blurred overlay for readability

## Technologies Used

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite as the build tool
- SWC for fast refresh
- ESLint for code quality
- CSS for styling with RTL support

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdelrhman612/prayar-reactjs.git
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd abdelrhman612-prayar-reactjs
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally

## API Usage

The app uses the [Aladhan API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api) to fetch prayer times. The current implementation fetches times for a specific date (03-09-2024) - you may want to update this to use the current date.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── App.tsx            # Main application component
├── components/
│   ├── Cities/        # City selection component
│   └── Prayer/        # Prayer time display component
├── data/
│   └── Cities.tsx     # List of available Egyptian cities
└── assets/            # Static assets (background image)
```

## Customization

### Adding More Cities

To add more cities, edit the `src/data/Cities.tsx` file and add new city objects following the same format:

```typescript
{
  id: 6,
  name: "اسم المدينة",
  value: "API_City_Name"
}
```

### Styling

The main styles are in `src/index.css`. You can modify:

- Background image by replacing `src/assets/bg.jpg`
- Colors in the CSS variables
- Layout and spacing

## Future Improvements

- Add automatic date detection
- Include sunrise and sunset times
- Add notifications for upcoming prayers
- Implement location detection
- Add dark/light mode toggle
